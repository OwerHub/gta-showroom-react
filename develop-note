 Issue1: 
 the max and min cars function is not a best practice. 
    - I have refactor the code, that call 1x the function
    - There's some car, what have a fixed position, not count the space
    - Some "garage" is flexibile, have no maximum space

Issue2: 
    - I need a online photo-galery, the img folder is not the best for netlify

for complete phase: 
    - Build a search field
    - Every garage shows the max space, free space, and etc.


Next phase: 
    - separate file for every car, more data, more photos what u see, when U click the car and open the modal. 

- note: 
    -maybe must change the data structure. The car's json contain the id of the garage (and car's place order in the garage)
